this is technically just the place where i will put my comments on my current code/work


I currently have encoder.py as a basic classification model using nn.TransformerEncoder and then using connecting that with a classification head (fc here) and it will be used to classify the difficulty of a given hold.

Next goal:

I need to fix/update my train data to allow the encoder to train on the dataset.
